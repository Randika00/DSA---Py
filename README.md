A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to create, define, manipulate and manage databases. It provides a way for organizations to store, 
organize and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently in an organized manner. DBMSs are like electronic filing cabinets that help users store, organize, and 
retrieve data quickly and efficiently.
